In 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison 
by a military court for a crime they didn't commit
These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade
to the Los Angeles underground. 
Today still wanted by the government they survive as soldiers of fortune. 
If you have a problem
If no one else can help
And if you can find them
Maybe you can hire...
The A-Team.
